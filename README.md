# cs-tradeup-calculator
Trade up calculator for counter-strike, script that exports a csv of a list of many possible combinations of tradeups and shows how profitable each is

## Notes
- Currently not fully accurate as prices for some skins are lower than they should be
- only does 10x combinations for now because its too slow
